# MCP Server

The awork MCP [(Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server provides AI assistants and language models with direct access to awork's API functionality. This enables seamless integration of awork capabilities into AI-powered workflows.

<Warning>The awork MCP server is under active development and may change without notice.</Warning>

## Endpoint

```
https://api.awork.com/api/v1/mcp
```

## Authentication

The MCP server requires authentication using one of the following methods:

### OAuth 2.0 with PKCE

The MCP server supports OAuth 2.0 authentication with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for secure authorization flows. This is the recommended approach for applications that can securely handle the OAuth flow.

**Note:** Dynamic client registration is not currently supported. You'll need to register your application and obtain client credentials through the standard awork developer process.

To register a public API client, see [Client Application](/authentication#client-application).

### Bearer Token Authentication

Alternatively, you can authenticate using an API key in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

To obtain an API key, see [Getting an API key](/authentication#getting-an-api-key).

## Supported Actions

The MCP server provides access to core awork functionality, allowing AI assistants to perform various actions on behalf of users:

### Additional Capabilities

The MCP server continues to expand its capabilities. For the most up-to-date list of supported actions, consult the **Tools** list of the MCP server after connecting to it.

## Rate Limiting

The MCP server enforces the same rate limits as the standard awork API. See the [Rate Limits](/rate-limits) documentation for details.

## Permissions

Actions performed through the MCP server are subject to the same permission model as the standard API. The authenticated user or API token must have appropriate permissions for the requested operations. Refer to the [Permissions](/permissions) documentation for more information.

## Examples

### Visual Studio Code

In VSCode, add the MCP server to the `mcp.json` configuration file like this:
```json title="mcp.json"
{
	"servers": {
		"awork": {
			"url": "https://api.awork.com/api/v1/mcp/",
			"type": "http",
			"headers": {
				"Authorization": "Bearer ${input:awork-api-key}",
				"Content-Type": "application/json",
				"Accept": "application/json"
			}
		}
	},
	"inputs": [
		{
			"type": "promptString",
			"id": "awork-api-key",
			"description": "awork API Key",
			"password": true
		}
	]
}
```

It will then prompt you to enter the awork API Key when starting the server. More details [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

### Claude Code

In Claude Code, add the MCP server using the following command, replacing `{api-key}` with your actual API key:
```sh
claude mcp add --transport http awork https://api.awork.com/api/v1/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer {api-key}"
```
