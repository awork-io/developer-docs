## Getting help with the API

These Developer Docs should contain all details you need to successfully build apps and integrations with the awork API. We're happy to answer your questions in our [awork Community Developer Forum.](https://community.awork.com/c/developer-forum/17)

Please create a separate issue for each question. If you have issues with a particular request, please include as much detail as possible. Most importantly, we need the **Trace-Id** and **Edge Ref** to be able to help you quickly.

## Finding the Edge Ref

The **Edge Ref** is an identifier added by our edge provider that can identify a request before it appears in our systems.

- The `X-Edge-Ref` header is available in the API response. It is therefore recommended to log this header value for failed requests.

## Finding the Trace-Id

The **Trace-Id** is an awork-internal identifier that can identify an operation. With this id, we can look up a particular request and use this to investigate potential issues and provide support.

- The `Trace-Id` header is returned in the majority of API responses. It is therefore recommended to log this header value for failed requests.
- The `traceId` property can be found in the error response body.
- The `traceId` property is also set in the webhook event metadata.
