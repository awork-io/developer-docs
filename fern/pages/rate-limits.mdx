The awork API limits the number of requests external API clients can make to a workspace. These limits depend on the plan of the workspace. The limits are shared by all external client applications across the workspace.

| Plan            | Limit                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Basic           | 1000/minute, 50/second |
| Business        | 1000/minute, 50/second |
| Enterprise      | 3000/minute, 50/second |

Other limits can apply to certain endpoints or can be introduced temporarily to provide a reliable service quality.

The API responds with `429 Too Many Requests` when the limit has been reached. The response also contains headers that explain the rate limit, including the time until the limit resets, in seconds (`RateLimit-Reset`).

```sh
ratelimit-limit: 50
ratelimit-remaining: 49
ratelimit-reset: 47
x-ratelimit-limit-second: 50
x-ratelimit-remaining-second: 49
x-ratelimit-limit-minute: 3000
x-ratelimit-remaining-minute: 2999
```

We recommend developers of client applications to read these header values and use a back-off time to fail gracefully and wait for the limit to reset to continue making requests.
