## Creating a company

Creating a company is easy. The only required field for creating a company is the `name`.

```sh title="Request" {4}
curl -X POST "https://api.awork.com/api/v1/companies" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "My first company"
         }'
```
