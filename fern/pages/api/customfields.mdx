Custom fields are fields in awork in which individual information for tasks can be stored. Custom fields are created at the workspace level, activated for a project and then used at the task level. The fields can then be found in the task details.

## Types for fields

The following types are available for custom fields:

| Type            | Description                                | 
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `text`          | A text input field.                        |
| `number`        | A number input field.                      |
| `date`          | Date selection.                            |
| `datetime`      | Date and time selection.                   |
| `select`        | Pre-defined selection options.             |

| `boolean`       | A checkbox.                                |

## Creating a custom field

To create a custom field, you need to send a POST request to the custom field definitions endpoint:

```sh title="Create a text custom field"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/customfielddefinitions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
            "name": "Service Level",
            "type": "text",
            "entity": "task"
         }'
```

The response contains the `customFieldDefinitionId` which is required for the following requests.

## Linking a custom field to a project

Next, the custom field must be linked to a project before a value can be set for a task. To do so, you need to send a POST request to the project custom fields endpoint:

```sh title="Link a custom field to a project"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects/projectId/linkcustomfielddefinition \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
            "customFieldDefinitionId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
            "order": 1
         }'
```

## Setting a custom field value for a task

Finally, you can set a value for the custom field for a task. To do so, you need to send a POST request to the task's  `/setCustomFields` endpoint:

```sh title="Set a custom field value for a task"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/tasks/taskId/setcustomfields \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
            {
                "customFieldDefinitionId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
                "textValue": "S1: Business Critical"
            }
         ]'
```
