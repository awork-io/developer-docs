awork allows you to upload files and images to tasks, projects, comments and many other entities.

## Upload a file

Uploading a file is easy. You can upload files up to 1000MB in size.

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/tasks/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/files \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'File=@/path/to/file.png'
```

## Upload a profile image

Several entities in awork support profile images. This is how you can upload an image for a project profile icon:

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/files/images/projects/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'File=@/path/to/file.png'
```
