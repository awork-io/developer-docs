awork allows you to upload files and images to tasks, projects, comments and many other entities.

## Upload a file to a task

Uploading a file takes three steps.
1. Generate upload URL
2. Upload the file
3. Link it with an entity such as a task

```sh title="Generate Upload URL"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/files/generateUploadURL \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

The response will look like this:
```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://upload.awork.com/...",
  "uploadId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

Then use the returned `uploadUrl` to upload the file:
```sh title="Upload File"
curl -X PUT https://upload.awork.com/... \
  -H 'Content-Type: image/png' \
  --data-binary @/path/to/file.png
```

Once that is done, link the uploaded file with a task:
```sh title="Link File with Task"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/tasks/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/files/byUploadId \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "uploadId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "fileName": "file.png"
      }'
```

## Upload a profile image

Several entities in awork support profile images. This is how you can upload an image for a project profile icon:

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/files/images/projects/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'File=@/path/to/file.png'
```
