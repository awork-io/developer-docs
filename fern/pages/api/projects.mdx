Projects are one of the core entities in the awork API. They represent a collection of tasks and other resources that are related to a specific project. Projects can be used to organize work, track progress, and collaborate with others in awork.

## How to work with projects

There are two major ways for creating a project in awork: using a project template or from scratch. See the [Project Template](./projecttemplates.mdx) endpoint for more information on how to manage project templates.

### Creating a project from scratch

Creating a project from scratch is easy. The only required field for creating a project is the `name`.

```json {4}
curl -X POST "https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "My new project"
         }'
```

### Creating a project from a template

To create a project from a project template, the `projectTemplateId` has to be passed in the `POST /projects` request.

```json {5}
curl -X POST "https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "My new project from a template",
           "projectTemplateId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
         }'
```
