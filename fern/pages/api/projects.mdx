Projects are one of the core entities in the awork API. They represent a collection of tasks and other resources that are related to a specific project. Projects can be used to organize work, track progress, and collaborate with others in awork.

## How to work with projects

There are two major ways for creating a project in awork: using a project template or from scratch. See the [Project Template](./projecttemplates.mdx) endpoint for more information on how to manage project templates.

### Creating a project from scratch

Creating a project from scratch is easy. The only required field for creating a project is the `name`.

```sh title="Request" {4}
curl -X POST "https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "My new project"
         }'
```

### Creating a project from a template

To create a project from a project template, the `projectTemplateId` has to be passed in the `POST /projects` request.

```sh title="Request" {5}
curl -X POST "https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "name": "My new project from a template",
           "projectTemplateId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
         }'
```

### Working with retainer projects

Retainer projects are projects which have at least one retainer budget. They have the `isRetainer` property set to `true`. The `timebudget` property of a retainer project cannot be updated manually but instead shows the sum of all timebudgets of all retainer budgets of the project.
In order to turn a retainer project back to a one-off budget, all retainer budgets have to be deleted.

### Calculated properties

The following properties are calculated and cannot be set manually:

- `trackedDuration` -> The sum of the `duration` of all time entries of the project. If the `deductNonBillableHours` property of the project is set to `false`, only time entries with `isBillable` set to `true` are included in the calculation.
- `plannedDuration` -> The sum of plannedDuration of all tasks of the project.
- `tasksCount` -> The number of tasks of the project.
- `tasksDoneCount` -> The number of tasks of the project which are done.
- Special case for `timebudget`: The `timebudget` property of a retainer project cannot be updated manually but instead shows the sum of all timebudgets of all retainer budgets of the project.

## Project Comments

Project comments allow for discussions and communication about projects. You can add comments to a project using the following endpoint:

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/comments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "This is a comment on the project"
  }'
```

### Mentioning Users in Comments

You can mention users in comments by using a special syntax with the user's Id. When a user is mentioned, they will receive a notification based on their notification settings.

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/comments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "<p>~[userId:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000] Take a look at this project</p>"
  }'
```

The syntax for mentioning a user is: `~[userId:{userId}]` where `{userId}` is the Id of the user you want to mention.

### Notifying Project Members

In addition to mentioning specific users, you can notify all members of a project:

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/projects/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/comments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "<p>~[project] This will notify all users in this project</p>"
  }'
```

You can use:
- `~[project]` to notify all members of this project
- `~[workspace]` to notify all users in the workspace
