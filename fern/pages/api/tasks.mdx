Tasks represent the smallest unit of work in awork. They are used to break down larger chunks of work, track progress, and collaborate with others.

## Types of Tasks

There are two types of tasks: project tasks and private tasks. This is identified by the `baseType` field in the task object, which can be either `projecttask` or `private`.

## Creating a Task

The following properties are required when creating a task:

```sh title="Request" {4-8}
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My first task",
    "baseType": "projecttask",
    "typeOfWorkId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "taskStatusId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
  }'
```

## Subtasks

Subtasks have almost the same properties as tasks, but they also have a `parentId` property that references the parent task. This is how you can create a subtask:

```sh title="Request" {9}
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My first task",
    "baseType": "projecttask",
    "typeOfWorkId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "taskStatusId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "parentId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
  }'
```

<Note>The subtask has to be in the same project as the parent task.</Note>

## Checklist Items

Each task comes with a checklist of simple items that can be checked off. This is how you can create a checklist item:

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/tasks/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/checklistItems \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My first checklist item"
  }'
```

## Task Lists

Tasks can be in one or several task lists. This is how you can add a task to a task list or change the list:

```sh title="Request"
curl -X POST https://api.awork.com/api/v1/tasks/changelists \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
	{
		"taskId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
		"taskLists": [
			{
				"id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
			}
		]
	}
]'
