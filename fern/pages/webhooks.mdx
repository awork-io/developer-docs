Webhooks allow application developers to receive and react to changes happening in awork without constantly polling and checking for updates. They are a powerful way to integrate awork with your own applications or third-party services.

A webhook is triggered for an entire workspace. For example, on the `project-added` webhook, you receive events for all projects created in your workspace, regardless of who created them or which team they belong to. This means that user permissions and roles are not checked and must be evaluated by you, the developer, if relevant.

## Configuration

To configure a webhook in awork:

1. Go to your awork workspace.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
3. Open the **Integration Library** and select **Webhooks**.

You will be prompted to provide:
- A **name** for the webhook.
- The **URL** where the webhook should send requests.
- Optional **authorization information**, which can be added as a header. Specify the header name and value if needed.

Next, select the events you want this webhook to trigger on. The following event types are supported:

| Event Type                | Description                                                                 |

Once configured, you can trigger a test event to your webhook URL to ensure everything is working as expected.

### Testing Your Webhook

To test your webhook, you can use tools like [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/) or [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/requestbin). These tools allow you to inspect incoming webhook requests and verify the payload structure.

## Receiving a Webhook

When the configured event occurs, awork will send an HTTP `POST` request to the configured URL. It will contain the configured authorization header and value, if set.

The request body will contain the event metadata as well as the entity that triggered the event. For the `project-added` event, this can look like in this example:

## Responding to a Webhook

awork expects a webhook request to return with a successful response within 30 seconds. Otherwise, the event will be marked as failed and retried for up to 10 times.

Should a configured webhook integration fail for more than 10 times without a successful response, it will be paused until a user enables it again in the Integration settings page.
