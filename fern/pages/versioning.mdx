## API Versions

The awork API provides two versions for certain endpoints:

### v1 (Default)
The v1 API is the default version and uses the following URL pattern:
```
https://api.awork.com/api/v1/{endpoint}
```

### v2 (Selected Endpoints)
Some endpoints offer a v2 version to introduce improvements without breaking changes:
```
https://api.awork.com/api/v2/{endpoint}
```

Note that v2 is not available for all endpoints. The v2 endpoints are specifically designed to provide enhanced functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility with their v1 counterparts. Please refer to the specific endpoint documentation to check if a v2 version is available.
