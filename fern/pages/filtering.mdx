The Awork API supports a wide range of filters that can be applied to most of our API endpoints.

A filter can be applied by adding a `filterby` expression to the request URL:

```sh
 /users?filterby=FirstName eq 'Sebastian'
```

Important: Special characters (like `?`, `&` and `=`) within a string filter value need to be properly URL encoded.

Correct:
```sh
filterby=name eq 'awork %26 co'
```

Incorrect:
```sh
filterby=name eq 'awork & co'
```

If you want to filter by a nested property, you can do this by separating the properties by `/`.

## Logical Operations

You can invert the expression by using `not` before the statement

```sh
 /users?filterby=not FirstName eq 'Sebastian'
```

Furthermore, you can combine expressions using the logical operator `and`

```sh
/projects?filterby=PlannedDuration le 200 and PlannedDuration gt 3.5 
```

as well as the logical operator `or`

```sh
/projects?filterby=PlannedDuration le 200 or PlannedDuration gt 300 
```

Precedence is defined with `(` and `)`.

You can also use the `any` operator in combination with `eq false` to filter for items that do not contain a specific value.

```sh
/tasks?filterby=lists/any(l: l/name eq 'Draft') eq false
```

## Data Types

The data types DateTime and Guid have to be prefixed with the corresponding type identifier `datetime` and `guid`, respectively, e.g.

* `/users?filterby=birthDate ge datetime'2018-04-03T00:00'`
* `/users?filterby=id eq guid'12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-ddddeeeeffff'`

## Operators

| Operator   | Description                                                                                                 | Query                                                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eq`       | The `eq` operator filters and returns the items which match the filter term.                                | `/users?filterby=firstName eq 'Neil'`                         |
| `ne`       | The `ne` operator filters and returns the items which do not match the filter term.                         | `/users?filterby=firstName ne 'Neil'`                         |
| `endswith` | The `endswith` operator filters and returns the items which end with the filter term.                       | `/users?filterby=endswith(firstName,'Neil')`                  |
| `startswith` | The `startswith` operator filters and returns the items which start with the string.                      | `/users?filterby=startswith(firstName,'Neil')`                |
| `substringof` | The `substringof` operator filters and returns the items which contain the filter term.                  | `/users?filterby=substringof('Neil',firstName)`               |
| `gt`       | The `gt` operator filters and returns the items which are greater than the filter term.                     | `/users?filterby=birthDate gt datetime'2018-04-03T00:00'`     |
| `lt`       | The `lt` operator filters and returns the items which are less than the filter term.                        | `/users?filterby=birthDate lt datetime'2018-04-03T00:00'`     |
| `le`       | The `le` operator filters and returns the items which are less than or equal to the filter term.            | `/users?filterby=birthDate le datetime'2018-04-03T00:00'`     |
| `ge`       | The `ge` operator filters and returns the items which are greater than or equal to the filter term.         | `/users?filterby=birthDate ge datetime'2018-04-03T00:00'`     |
| `any`      | The `any` operator iterates through the main entity (Project), executes the condition and returns the filtered list of projects where any member with a first name of 'Neil' exists. | `/projects?filterby=members/any(p: p/firstName eq 'Neil')` |
| `count`    | The `count` operator iterates through the main entity (Project), and returns the filtered list of projects that have less than 10 members. | `/projects?filterby=members/count() lt 10` |
| `tolower`  | The `tolower` operator can be used to convert strings to lowercase, which can be helpful for string comparison. | `/projects?filterby=tolower(name) eq 'website'` |

<Warning>Not all operators can be used in combination or nested.</Warning>
