## Welcome to the awork Developer Documentation

![Welcome!](/assets/api/introduction01.png "Welcome")

Welcome to this developer documentation for the awork API, which allows developers to access and extend awork's features and data. We're glad you're here, and we hope that this documentation will help you build something awesome.

At awork, we think API first. We do our best to build a powerful and easy-to-use public API, which means that if you see something in awork, you can usually do that same thing via the API.

To get started, check out the following resources:

* Create a free [awork](https://www.awork.com) account.
* Learn more about [authentication](./authentication.mdx) with the API.
* Check out the [API Reference](/apiv1) to see all the endpoints and operations supported by the API.
* [Subscribe](https://form.123formbuilder.com/form-6455567/api-newsletter-signup) to API updates and other developer news.
