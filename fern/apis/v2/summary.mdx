This API Reference lists all entities and operations supported by the awork API v2.

## API v2

This is the second version of the awork API. All features and concepts of the v1 apply.
The goal of the v2 is to provide new versions of existig endpoints which introduce mayor breaking changes. v1 and v2 are usually backwards compatible, so that entities created via v1 can be used in v2 and vice versa to give users time to migrate.
New features will be added to the v1.
